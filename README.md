> He possesses great intelligence and knowledge about the universe, and specializes in universal telepathic links. Even though he was already weaker than Vegeta before he taught Goku, King Kai is still a veritable library of skills, techniques and literally centuries of wisdom.

## Installation

Install [Go](https://golang.org), then run:

```sh
go get -u github.com/slimsag/kingkai
```

## Running

First use [`vegeta attack`](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta) to produce some before and after gob files:

```sh
$ mkdir before
$ echo "GET https://google.com" | vegeta attack -duration=5s -name 'Google.com @ 50 QPS / 5s' > before/query1.bin

$ mkdir after
$ echo "GET https://google.com" | vegeta attack -duration=5s -name 'Google.com @ 50 QPS / 5s' > after/query1.bin

$ tree before/ after/
before/
â””â”€â”€ query1.bin
after/
â””â”€â”€ query1.bin

0 directories, 2 files
```

Then make use of `kingkai`:

```sh
$ kingkai before/ after/
```

Which outputs the following Markdown result:

> ### Google.com @ 2 QPS / 30s
